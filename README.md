## 3D Kinematics Visualisation

Kinematics is a branch of classical mechanics concerned with the motion of particles, bodies, points, and systems of bodies, without considering the forces that cause this motion.

Given the equations that describe the position of a particle in three dimensions, the goal of this project is to visualise how various kinematic properties change over time.

The position of a particle in space R, may be described by an equation such as [sin(3t), cos(t), cos(2t)]. This vector allows us to determine the trajectory of the particle. i.e. it's position at any point in time.
From this we can determine the particle's velocity, acceleration and radius of curvature among other properties of interest over any specified time span.

For the visualisation of the example equation above, see below:
